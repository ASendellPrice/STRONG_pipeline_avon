# Running STRONG on avon

This repository outlines how to run the metagenome assembler STRONG (Strain Resolution ON Graphs, https://github.com/chrisquince/STRONG) on Warwick's HTC avon. The bulk of the pipeline runs within a singularity image prepared by Warwick's Scientific Computing RTP. Taxonomic classification via gtdbtk is conducted outside of the container.
